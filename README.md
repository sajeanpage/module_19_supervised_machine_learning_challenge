# Module 19 Supervised Machine Learning Challenge
## Background

Lending services companies allow individual investors to partially fund personal loans as well as buy and sell notes backing the loans on a secondary market.  I was tasked to use this data to create machine learning models to classify the risk level of given loans. Specifically, comparing the Logistic Regression model and Random Forest Classifier.

## Prediction

After reviewing the data, I concluded that a Logistic Regression model would score better than a Random Forest Classifier.  I based this prediction on the source data set containing all continuose values for the independent variables.  I felt as if this circumstance would perform better with a regression model.

## Comparision

After comparing the models I have determined the following:
- The Logistic Regression model modelled the data exceptionally well with training and testing scores exceeding 99%
- The Random Forest Classifier modelled the data exceptionally as well also with training and testing scores exceeding 99%
- Both models performed to near perfection. Confusion matrices for the Logistic Regression model and Random Forest Classifier are in blue and red respectively.
