# Module 19 Supervised Machine Learning Challenge
## Background

Lending services companies allow individual investors to partially fund personal loans as well as buy and sell notes backing the loans on a secondary market.  I was tasked to use this data to create machine learning models to classify the risk level of given loans. Specifically, comparing the Logistic Regression model and Random Forest Classifier.

## Prediction

After reviewing the data, I concluded that a Logistic Regression model would score better than a Random Forest Classifier.  I based this prediction on the source data set containing all continuose values for the independent variables.  I felt as if this circumstance would perform better with a regression model.

## Comparision

As the new lead analyst for the New York Citi BikeLinks I am now responsible for overseeing the largest bike-sharing program in the United States. In my new role, you am expected to generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program.

After analyzing some of the data I have determined the following:
- Riders were mostly males and females between the ages of 22 and 40 during this time period.  
- With exceptions accounted for, the 28 year old males were the largest constituency.
- Most rides were started at stations near affluent zip codes near leasure locations like shopping districts or parks.
- The mean bike usage was about 550 trips during the observation period.
- There were some outliers that made over 1600 trips during this period.  Those bikes are good candidates for maintenance.
- Bikes that were the most used usually completed their rides near an interstate, bridge, or a major transportation connector
